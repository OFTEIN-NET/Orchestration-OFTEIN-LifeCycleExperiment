OF@TEIN experiment lifecycle to describe how researchers carry out experiments over the shared infrastructure. This lifecycle interpretation helps OF@TEIN operator to provide the needed resources for experiments and also helps the users to understand different stages of experiments and matching support tools.

The proposed "Automated LifeCycle Experiment Tools" is used for OF@TEIN to facilitate easy and fast experimentation by leveraging automated resource provisioning and experiment execution.
